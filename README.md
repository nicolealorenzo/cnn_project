## Project Description

### Goal: 
Health is a key aspect that affects lifestyle, and lifestyle can also have an affcet as to how health resources are provided. Through the data, we wanted to locate where hospitals are in the country and show thier relation to the communities in the area. Find out how different areas thoughout the nation are being represented through health resources and vise versa. This is important to know to see what areas are being underrepresented in good health care, and what socioeconomic factors play a role. 

### Data: 
We obtained our hospital data from the [Hospital General Information](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/hospital-general-information) dataset provided on Kaggel. The data about the communities within the United States was collected from the [2015 US Census Demographic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data), also provided on Kaggel. As a team, we cleaned the data and merged both datasets to get the information we needed. 

### Audience:
The main focus for this project is targeted for the government and healthcare professionals. By viewing the data, they are able to see what areas are being underrepresented and be able to focus attention on such communities. It's also important to see where different qualities of hospitals are centrified in order to understand the population around it and how it can be used cater to a grater community. 

## Background On The Project

### Topic
Health is a topic that our team decided was significant to the community and ourselves. We wanted to dive into data that had a significant impact and meening that would actaully have an affect on people. We come from different backgrounds and healthcare is something that all areas should have the access of, but that isn't always the case. Our project is something that represents different backgrounds and how they are reflected in provided healthcare. 

### Vison
We wanted to create a Shiny app that allows the user to put themselves in different areas of the country and see what healthcare in that area is like. Where are the best and worst places to get health services? Why are there so many hospitals in a certain area, but none in another? The point is to find out what about a community makes it worth the resources or not. Each of us wanted to display the data in our own unique way, but all falll under the same goal.

## Visualizing our Findings:

### Figure 1: 
The first figure visualizes the median income verses the population to hospital ratio. The data concludes that in most states, there are a greater amount of hospitals in middle class areas. Although, the population being served at these hospitals are individually a small amount. This may be becuase there are more hopsitals within a similar population area. 

### Figure 2:
The second figure visualizes hospitals thoughout the US based on rating and income. The user is able to view the different types of hosptials based on thier national rating and where they are located. The markers on the map chnage color based on the areas average income. (Green = High, Orange = Medium, Red = Low). Through the data, most of the hospitals are located in areas of medium income (>$35,000, <=$100,000). The data also shows that a lot of staes (mainly in the midwest) are lacking quality healthcare, and this maybe something to consider. 

### Figure 3: 
The final figure explores the different type of hospitals in selected cities. This data is important becuase it showcases what type of healthcare is provided. Although there may be a good number of hospitals in the area, doesn't mean that they all provide the services needed to support everyone in the community.    


## Conclusions

### Areas of Struggle
The main issue with collaborating was the technichal problems. Trying to merge everyone's visualizations into one platform was the main problem.

### Areas of Success
All of our visualizations capture the purpose of the data in a unique way. Each visualization benefits from the others in a way that helps the user understand the data in further detail. Our findings conclude that mainly middle class areas have better quality hospitals and also shows what types of hospitals are being provided.
